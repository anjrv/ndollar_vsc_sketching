# Sketching client example

### Description

This is a rudimentary example of how talking to the Java gRPC server could be done.

The current version is an extremely simple connect and method call button with dummy data. I will extend this with a mouse and touch listener to enable us to test actual calls and add template stroke combinations as required.

### Usage

This is the most basic JavaScript/NPM NextJS example project with some added code. Usage is largely the same.

* Install dependencies: `npm i`
* Run the development client: `npm run dev`

**There are likely some stupid things that may happen due to the path bind to the .proto file. Ensure the npm commands are run from the project root.**
